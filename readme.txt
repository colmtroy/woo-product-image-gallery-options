Switch on/off WooCommerce 3.0+ Product Image Gallery options on a per product basis.

== Description ==

Switch on/off WooCommerce 3.0+ Product Image Gallery options on a per product basis. 
(NOTE: Fully tested with WooCommerce 3.0 and 3.1). 

WooCommerce 3.0+ added a series of new (awesome!) product image gallery options. But right now, these options are activated for all products. This plugin lets you show/hide the new WooCommerce Product Image Gallery options on individual products by adding 3 new check boxes to your Edit Product screen.
